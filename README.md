<h1> Hey there. I'm Evelin...</h1>

<p> Thank you so much for visiting my website! I'm interested in becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow because I want to be surrounded by students and mentors that are passionate about the technology field. Being an hispanic women with no college degree, it's very hard not to come across certain questions/comments like "Why aren't you married?" "You can't apply here without a degree." "Women can only apply to other jobs except tech." I really want to prove them wrong. Currently at my job, everyone that has a title has a degree. Majority are men. Sometimes I do see favoritism. Those that want to grow more in the company and has a great performance unfortunately don't get the opportunity. I wanted to change that. And I did. At the age of 24, I became Supervisor and have had the prvilegde to be in this position for a year and 4 months. However for my voice to be heard is tricky. I want to change work enviroments and habits. I want to be surrounded by aspiring diverse students, mentors, web developers, UX, UI, people that want to make a difference in the world! And we all know technology has a huge impact. Right now, the only way we can get in touch with our love ones is through technology. I want to solve issues, create solutions, and do more research on how we can make a wonderful experience to any customer looking at a particular website. I've looked at the TKH website and it's very exciting to hopefully become a part of this tech family!</p>
